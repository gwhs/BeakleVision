## Setup For Students

In order to properly setup your development environment you'll need to do a few things in VS Code

1. Install Python 3.13.3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Create a .venv in VS Code that uses the python version you just installed (and not system python). Start with CMD + Shift + P to use the search bar and then type in Python: Create Environment. From there select venv, then Python 3.13.3, and install requirements.txt.
3. Install python extensions for VS Code in the extensions tab. At minimum I'd install Python, Pylance, and Mypy.
